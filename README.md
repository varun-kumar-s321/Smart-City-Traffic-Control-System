# Smart City Traffic Control System 🚦

## Description
This project implements a smart traffic light system using C programming.
Traffic signal timings are dynamically adjusted based on traffic density.

## Features
- Density-based green signal timing
- Circular junction control (4 roads)
- Reduces congestion
- Simple and efficient logic

## Technologies Used
- C Programming
- GCC Compiler

## How It Works
1. Traffic density is read
2. Green time is adjusted
3. Signals rotate in circular manner
